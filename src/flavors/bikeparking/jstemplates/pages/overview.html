<h1>About</h1>

<p>We're collecting information about bicycle infrastructure and we need your
  help!</p>

<p>This survey will help us estimate how many bicycles can be parked at our
  local train stations. This will give the us better information parking
  availability so we can have better information to advocate for more!</p>

<p>This tool is being powered by Shareabouts, a simple web app for crowdsourced
  mapping. You can use it to collect public input on maps - either by adding new
  places or surveying existing ones. People can comment, discuss other people's
  suggestions, and express support. Read more about Shareabouts at
